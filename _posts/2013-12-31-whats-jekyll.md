[JEKYLL](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

The purpose of this series of blogposts is to define the porblem of analysis of text sentiment, find datasets for training, describe possible solutions of the problem, compare them and benchmark their performance thus simulating end-to-end process from formally described task to a fully working and highly accurate model or application.
