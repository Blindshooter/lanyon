The purpose of this series of blogposts is to define the porblem of analysis of text sentiment, find datasets for training, describe possible solutions of the problem, compare them and benchmark their performance thus simulating end-to-end process from formally described task to a fully working and highly accurate model or application.

These posts and big part of related coding were developed with help of people in [Ukrainian Data Science Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1081438678569043/). 

1. [Task Definition. Data Sources]()
2. [Feature Engineering]()
3. [Linear Algorithms]()
4. [Tree Based Algorithms]()
5. [Deep Learning. Keras Intro.]()
6. [Deep Learning II. LSTM]()
7. [Deep Learning II. Advanced Deep Learning]()
8. [Productization]()

I encourage you to follow the links in order they appeared, however if you want to know about one particular topic - feel free to jump to it straight away. 

In a nutshell, first parts of these posts will be focused on the business aspects more than on development. Next part will briefly cover simple (in terms, that not deep) machine learning algorithms. As for this particular task they work well enough to be considered into production, however they are well covered in many articles all over the internet. Later we will see how deep learnning is able to tackle problem of extracting sentiment from the sentence.
